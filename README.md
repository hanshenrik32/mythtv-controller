 First start is slow, if your mythtv is setup right. The program have to
 convert all the gfx/cdcover/dvdcover file to internal format.

 After start. First jump to F1 menu for setup. 
 Check the database setup for connect to mythtv or kodi backend. You can change the system type by spacekey.

 After setup is okay.. restart the program to load the data from the mythtv

 the radio stations db will be installed by the mythtv-controller by first run if able to create db (again check password in config file.)
